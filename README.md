# Trend-Py-Sheets-Tab
Google Trends + Python + Google Sheets API + Tableau Public = Full Automation

Highlights the process I used to use Python to pull Google Trends data & webscrape 
then push the data to my Google Sheets account so Tableau Public will auto-refresh daily. 
To complete full automation convert .ipynb to .py and schedule routine kickoff using Windows Scheduler or Cron.

Disclaimer: Right now I am more of a data visualization guy so I am just functional with Python. 

#Step 1: Install needed Python packages and use documentation in links provided:
import pandas as pd
import requests
import itertools
from random import randint
import pygsheets
Link: https://github.com/nithinmurali/pygsheets

from bs4 import Beautiful Soup
Link: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

from pytrends.request import TrendReq

#Step 2: Set up authentication with google

#Step 3: Set up Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop

#Step 4: Use my Jupyter Notebook Trends project "Trend-Py-Sheets-Tab.ipynb" tweaking for your use case

#Step 5: Connect Tableau to Google Sheets and build dashboard

#Step 6: Publish to Tableau public - When publishing it will let you check a box for routine refreshing off Google Sheets
Note: As of 5/5/18 Google Sheets is the only way to have automated refreshing on Tableu Public

#Step 7: Save code as a .py and schedule on windows task scheduler or Cron.
